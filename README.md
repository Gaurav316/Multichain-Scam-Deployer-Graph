# Multichain-Scam-Deployer-Graph
A cross-chain intelligence toolkit that maps suspicious smart-contract deployers across Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum, and Base. Fetches deployer histories using *Scan V2 APIs, builds a structured NetworkX graph, extracts ML-ready behavioral features, and assigns heuristic risk scores to identify scam clusters and malicious deployment patterns.
